# resume

This is a single-page VueJS app designed to be an easy-to-update resume tool. It looks great on mobile, desktop, tablet, and print. This one is currently accessible at [https://cking0987.github.io/resume/](https://cking0987.github.io/resume/). Feel free to fork and use it for your own resume. All of the actual resume content is contained within /src/App.vue. Enjoy!
